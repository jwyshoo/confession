      <p>Iâ€™ve been meaning to tell you something for a while now, and I finally worked up the courage to say it. I really enjoy spending time with you, and the more I get to know you, the more I realize how special you are to me. 

Iâ€™ve developed feelings for you, and I wanted to be honest about it. I donâ€™t want to make things awkward, but I couldnâ€™t keep it to myself any longer. No matter what you feel, I value our connection and hope we can keep building on it.

Let me know what you think when youâ€™re ready. ðŸ˜Š</p>
